        Photography in my family has been important. My grandad had a passion to
        photography in his youth too,<br />
        and I had keen interest since childhood too. I usually burrowed without
        telling my grandad's point and shoot family camera in late 1990s.<br />
        Until one day he realised that he always gets some random cat&flower
        photos developed without his acknowledgment these photos are taken,
        <br />
        he got me my own first point and shoot camera. Which I took with me to
        my summer camps, photographed my family holidays and especially <br />
        I photographed my cats and dogs, and garden. In 2000s I photographed my
        school activities and school mates. Now we love and laugh at these
        images. <br />
        Eventually I developed serious interest to photography, that I studied
        BA in Photography at Falmouth University.

        <h4>1. My pets & other animals.</h4>
        <img class="boximage" src="cats.png" width="800" />
          In my childhood I photographed my cats a lot. 
          Also dogs, but I was such a cat person and I 
          loved my cats so much. In this photo can see
          their relationship was unexisting. Their names 
          were Fluffy and Prince.

        <h4>2. My family moments.</h4>
        <img class="boximage" src="brother.png" width="800"/>
            When my brother was younger, he loved to be photographer.
            Now not so much. But he also took my camera
            without asking me and I got mad at him that
            he used my film for his silly guy friends.

          <h4>3. My daily life.</h4>
            <img class="boximage" src="camps.png" width="800"/>
            Also I photographed a lot of things happening around me.
            I was shy and quiet child, and taking photos was perfect
            way to be social but hide. In my youth I noticed the same
            that camera helped me as an introvert to hide yet be out 
            with people.

          <h4>4. Miscellaneous.</h4>
          <img class="boximage" src="myart.JPG" width="700"/>
            My art, my school moments and garden were also themes I photographed.
            Nature since my childhood has been my playground, 
            and I am still very much connected to nature. I had a
            dream to become a flower photographer, which sounds silly,
            but I wanted to make a photo book of flowers.
